# An Abstract: 
The best neighborhood is decidedly Squirrel Hill South. This was ultimately determined by ranking a combination of each of our member's metrics. To look at how many bus stops there are in each neighborhood and compare the bus stop density, the more dense the better for transportation in the neighborhood. Then to also look at total school enrollment of each neighborhood to find the one with the better social network. And finally to analyze the public facilities available in each neighborhood. After we combined our data we found that Squirrel Hill South came out on top as the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
